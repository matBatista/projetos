Non-relational databases
Non-relational databases are data management systems that donâ€™t apply a relational schema to the data. Non-relational databases are often referred to as NoSQL database, even though some support a variant of the SQL language.

There are four common types of Non-relational database commonly in use.

Key-value databases in which each record consists of a unique key and an associated value, which can be in any format.

Column family databases, which store tabular data comprising rows and columns, but you can divide the columns into groups known as column-families. Each column family holds a set of columns that are logically related together.
